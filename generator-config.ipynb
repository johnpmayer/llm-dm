The town's laws are fairly strict and punishments are severe, but there are few problems with crime due to the watchful eyes of the town's residents.

The town is operated by a group of three merchants who handle trade disputes and ensure the safety of the town's visitors. The town's lack of laws and relative freedom has led to an increase in illegal activity, but the merchants are quick to deal with any issues that arise. The majority of Starlight Grove's inhabitants are traders or adventurers passing through, with few permanent residents.\n"

To provide an additional challenge, the gang has set traps and snares throughout the cavern.
